Over this the reservations are shown in different colors to see directly if its a past reservation (blue), a current one (green) or a futre one (red). If you interact with a reservation it will be yellow. For each day and room there is the number of free spaces in the room-seperator, so you know directly if theres enough room or not. If you go over the cells the room and date cells get highlighted and the full date is shown in the header. Beside of this the overview is interactiv.
