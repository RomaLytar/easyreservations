"The overview is the visual output of the availability of all reservations in "
"a clean, informative and inuitive way. It shows the availabilty of your "
"rooms in a flexible time-period - the rooms and number of days to show are "
"selectable. With a click on the date-icon in the header you can select the "
"start-date of the overview in a datepicker. The overview cells have "
"different backgrounds: White for normal day, yellow for weekend, blue for "
"today and red for unavail. In addition to this the past days have a pattern "
"over the background. Over this the reservations are shown in different "
"colors to see directly if its a past reservation (blue), a current one "
"(green) or a futre one (red). If you interact with a reservation it will be "
"yellow. For each day and room there is the number of free spaces in the room-"
"seperator, so you know directly if theres enough room or not. If you go over "
"the cells the room and date cells get highlighted and the full date is shown "
"in the header. Beside of this the overview is interactiv. That means you can "
"click on it to add or edit reservations date and room very inuitive. On "
"approve or edit you can select or change the room directly by clicking on "
"the releated first cell (that one with the room number in it), so the date "
"wont get changed."
